            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am a passionate Cyber Security Specialist and creative thinker based in the city. 
                With over five years of experience in the tech industry, I specialize in 
                building responsive, user-friendly websites that bridge the gap between 
                complex backend logic and elegant frontend design.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey started with a simple curiosity about how the web works, which 
                quickly evolved into a professional career. When I'm not coding, you can 
                find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
                or capturing life through my camera lens. I believe in continuous learning 
                and always strive to stay ahead of industry trends.
            </p>
